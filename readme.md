# Iron web front end test 

Assuming you have already set up your machine with Node JS, before launch the script you must install the dependencies through **npm i**

###How to run the app:

```javascript
  ~: gulp
```

_navigate to your localhost on port 4000 http://localhost:4000_

et voila!

###How it works:

Courses.json send the course list, for each course there is a field called "level" where you can find the relationship with the 3 different levels **débutants**, **intermédiaires**, **avancés**.

Just edit the array and remove/add 0,1,2 if you'd like to display different courses per group.
